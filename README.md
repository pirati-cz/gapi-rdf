gapi-rdf
========

**Only for experimental purposes!**

This is a release of an unstable prototype version of GAPI RDF library. It's not tested in production at all.


Requirements
------------

Since the library uses Harmony proxies you need to execute Node.js with the `--harmony` runtime option:
```
    node --harmony script_using_gapi-rdf.js
```

When you see `Error: proxies not supported on this platform`, you've probably forgotten to add the option.
